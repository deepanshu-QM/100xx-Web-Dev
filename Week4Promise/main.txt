In a small coastal town where the sea hummed like an old radio, there lived a boy named Aarav who collected broken clocks.

Not normal clocks.

Clocks that had stopped at strange times.

3:17 AM.
11:11 PM.
6:02 AM.

He found them in flea markets, abandoned houses, even once buried in the sand after a storm. No one understood why he kept them. His room ticked with silence.

One night, during a power outage, something unusual happened.

All the broken clocks started ticking.

Not together. Not in rhythm.

Each one ticked at its
Each one ticked at its own speed — fast, slow, uneven — like a hundred different heartbeats.

Aarav froze.

Then one clock chimed.

3:17 AM.

The room shimmered.

The walls melted into mist, and he found himself standing on the same beach — but the sea was frozen mid-wave. Birds were suspended in the sky. Even the wind had stopped.

Time wasn’t moving.

Except for him.

He turned — and saw a girl sitting on the frozen wave as if it were a glass throne.

“You finally collected enough,” she said calmly.

“Enough what?” Aarav asked.

“Enough moments that people abandoned.”

She explained that every broken clock had stopped at a moment someone wished could change. Regret. Hope. Fear. Love. Each clock was a doorway to a paused second of reality.

“You can fix one,” she said. “Only one.”

Suddenly the clocks floated around him in the sky, each glowing with a memory not his own.

A missed goodbye.
A failed exam.
A proposal never made.
A train not caught.

Then he saw one labeled 6:02 AM.

His father’s hospital room.

The moment before the doctors said there was nothing more they could do.

His chest tightened.

“Choose carefully,” the girl warned. “Fixing one moment erases the lesson tied to it.”

He thought for a long time.

Then he shook his head.

“I won’t fix any.”

The frozen sea cracked.

“Why?” she asked.

“Because if I change one moment, I change who I am. And maybe the pain is what made me strong enough to stand here.”

The clocks shattered into sparks.

The wave unfroze.

The girl smiled faintly. “You were never meant to fix time. You were meant to understand it.”

Aarav woke up in his room.

The clocks were silent again.

All of them.

Except one.

It ticked normally.

Showing the correct time.

And for the first time in years, he didn’t try to stop it.
